This project uses Gensim's word2vec model to work with pre-trained word embeddings. Word embeddings are numerical representations of words that help capture their meanings and relationships based on context.

What Are Word Embeddings?
Word Embeddings: They convert words into vectors (arrays of numbers) that represent their meanings. Similar words have similar vectors, making it easier for machines to understand word relationships.

Pre-trained Models: The word2vec-google-news-300 model is trained on Google News data and provides 300-dimensional vectors for many words.

How to Use It:
Get Word Vectors: Retrieve the vector for a word, like vec_king = wv['king'], which gives you the numerical representation of "king".

Find Similar Words: Use wv.most_similar('cricket') to get words related to "cricket".

Measure Similarity: Check how similar two words are with wv.similarity('man', 'king'), which gives a score showing their similarity.

This setup helps analyze and understand text by using the relationships between words in a way that's easier for machines to process.
